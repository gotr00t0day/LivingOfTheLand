# Living Off The Land (LOTL) v0.11

**Author:** c0d3Ninja

A comprehensive privilege escalation enumeration tool designed for Linux/Unix security assessments. LOTL helps security professionals identify potential attack vectors by systematically checking for misconfigurations, exposed credentials, and vulnerable system components.

## Features

### üîç System Enumeration
- **System Information**: Gathers uname, hostname, uptime, and mount information
- **Dependency Detection**: Checks for required and optional system commands
- **SUID Binary Discovery**: Recursively finds SUID binaries across the filesystem

### üîë Credential Discovery
- **SSH Keys**: Locates private keys, known_hosts, and SSH configurations
- **Cloud Credentials**: Searches for AWS credentials and configurations
- **System Credentials**: Examines passwd, shadow, and authentication files
- **Application Secrets**: Finds .env files, API keys, and configuration files

### üìã File Analysis
- **History Files**: Analyzes bash/zsh history for sensitive commands
- **Log Files**: Checks system logs for authentication and security events
- **Backup Files**: Discovers backup copies of sensitive configurations
- **Sensitive Files**: Locates database dumps, private keys, and configuration files

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration-Driven
All enumeration targets are defined in `config/lotl.conf`, making the tool easily customizable for different environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Linux/Unix system
- g++ compiler with C++20 support
- Standard system utilities (cat, uname, hostname, etc.)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the LivingOfTheLand directory
cd LivingOfTheLand

# Compile the tool
make

# Clean previous builds (optional)
make clean

# Force rebuild (optional)
make rebuild
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run the tool
./lotl
```

### Output Sections
The tool provides organized output in the following sections:
1. **Dependency Check**: Shows available system commands
2. **System Information**: Displays system details
3. **Credential Files**: Contents of discovered credential files
4. **History Files**: Contents of shell history files
5. **SUID Files**: List of SUID binaries found on the system

## Configuration

### Customizing Checks
Edit `config/lotl.conf` to customize what the tool searches for:

```ini
[Dependencies]
required = cat, ifconfig, whoami, uname, hostname, uptime, mount
optional = curl, wget

[Credentials]
checkCreds = /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, ~/.aws/credentials, ~/.ssh/id_rsa

[bashHistory]
checkBashHistory = ~/.bash_history, ~/.zsh_history, ~/.bashrc

# ... additional sections for logs, SSH, backups, etc.
```

### Configuration Sections
- **Dependencies**: Required and optional system commands
- **Credentials**: Paths to credential files
- **Logs**: System log file locations
- **SSH**: SSH-related files and configurations
- **bashHistory**: Shell history and configuration files
- **BackUps**: Backup file patterns and locations
- **SensitiveFiles**: Application configs and sensitive data

## Security Considerations

### Responsible Usage
- **Authorized Testing Only**: Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- **Professional Context**: Intended for penetration testing, security assessments, and educational purposes

### Limitations
- Some checks may require elevated privileges
- Permission-denied errors are handled gracefully
- Results depend on file system permissions and access controls

## Development

### Building with Debug Info
```bash
# The Makefile includes debug flags by default
make clean && make
```

### Adding New Checks
1. Update `config/lotl.conf` with new paths or patterns
2. Modify parsing logic in `core/init.cpp` if needed
3. Add new tool modules in the `tools/` directory

## Version History
- **v0.3**: Current release with enhanced SUID detection and configuration-driven checks
